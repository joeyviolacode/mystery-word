## Mystery Word

This is a mystery word game with some personality.  There are both traditional and sinister versions of mystery word.  The sinister version uses an evil algorithm that never actually chooses a word until it must.  Included in the repo is an annotated demonstration of that algorithm called word-sifter-demo.py

The evil mystery word concept is set out in [this Nifty assignment](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2011/schwarz-evil-hangman/).  

### Requirements
There is no environment required for this other than an installation of python 3.  If running on Windows, one may need to comment out or alter the lines relating to the clear lambda.  They are there to give a cleaner terminal experience, but are currently written for a Mac.
