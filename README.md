## Mystery Word

This is a mystery word game with some personality.  There are both traditional and sinister versions of mystery word.  The sinister version uses an evil algorithm that never actually chooses a word until it must.  Included in the repo is an annotated demonstration of that algorithm called word-sifter-demo.py

### Requirements
There is no environment required for this other than an installation of python 3.
